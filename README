The CPRNG is a novelty hardware random number generator based on the movement of a chaotic pendulum as observed by a photo-interrupter. 

**CPRNGfirmware**
This directory contains the Arduino firmware to drive the Wentworth Institute Of Technology SEC project Chaotic Pendulum Random Number Generator.

The Arduino firmware requires the Cryptosuite library by Cathedrow. Available from: https://github.com/Cathedrow/Cryptosuite

**CPRNGUI**

This directory contains a PHP script for demonstrating one use of the output
of /dev/random.

**CPRNGD**

This directory contains a linux daemon that reads from /ttyACM0 (you'll have to recompile if you want to change that.. sorry) and inserts entropy into /dev/random.

**************VERSION HISTORY**************
*******************************************

**v1.1**
Includes the first working prototype of the CPRNG Daemon. (whic doesn't work
as a daeomon yet).
Also adds a small example PHP script that reads from /dev/random to give a 
nice GUI for demonstrating the output of the CPRNG.

**v1.0**
First version of the firmware that works with the pendulum. Output is in nicelly formatted hex, which isn't good for randomness!

**v0.5**

Implements the hashing functions. NO reading from the pendulum yet. Usefull
for debbugging.
